[![This Is The Video You Are Looking For](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1660514696/video_to_markdown/images/youtube--AAD9OO9EeQw-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/AAD9OO9EeQw "DCZia 30 in 1 Electronic Project Kit Badge Overview")

For those who don't like videos, here is a reasonable ordering of adding components:
* Pins (broken out all at once or a few at a time
* OLED Screen - top left, for pins
* Switches (next to battery, under keycaps hope)
* RGB LED - to the left of the other LEDS
* Speaker bottom right, on top of the spot of tape.  Polarity does not matter
* Battery case (big blank spot, bottom left)
* Key base (top right-should be obvious)
* Transformer (note THIS one is directional-the P side should line up with the P on the board)
* Potentiometer (next to the key base)
* Key Cap
